# Part 5
## 1
Writing test, I wasn't able to finish writing all the tests
## 2
service worker
## 3
I used next-i18next because it has an online tool called https://app.i18nexus.com/ where people can collaborate to write the translations 
## 4
I would host the static files on a CDN server. This will improve perfomance.
I would use next image, this downloads an appropriate image depending on screen size
I would use useSwr hook for fetching data because it caches data and only fetches new data
